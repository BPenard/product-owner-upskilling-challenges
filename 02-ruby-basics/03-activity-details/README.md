# Activity details

In this Ruby exercise, we'll get familiar with the Hash data type.

We'll focus on defining what is an activity for a team building session.

## Setup

Execute the following in the Terminal:

```bash
cd ~/lewagon-workshop/product-owner-upskilling-challenges/02-ruby-basics/03-activity-details/
code .
```

## Exercise

In this folder, you will find `details.rb` - The Ruby boilerplate of the exercise.

## Objectives

The goal is to display the details of one team building activity.

### Hash definition

All the details of an activity will be stored in a `Hash`.

Here are the characteristics of an activity:

- Name
- Category
- City
- Duration (in minutes)
- Number of participants
- Price (in EUR)

For instance, an Escape Game (Adventure) in Nantes of 60 minutes for 4 participants, charged 120 euros in total.

For each characteristic, define the correct **Ruby type** to use and the name of the key you will use in your Hash.

⚠ **VALIDATION:** Let's validate together the types and keys you've chosen.

### Creating the activity

Then **complete** the Hash within the Ruby file with the characteristics of your preferred activity for a team building.

### Displaying the activity

Here is the expected output for the `Escape Game` example:

```
Escape Game [ADVENTURE]
Located in Nantes
Duration of 60 minutes
For 4 participants
Charged 120€
```

Your turn! Complete the exercise.

## Git Commit

When you're done, don't forget to **commit and push** your changes.
