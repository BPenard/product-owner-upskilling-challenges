# Let's do some team building

In this second Ruby exercise, we'll get familiar with the Array data type.

We'll also discover the guiding theme of our challenges: activities for team building sessions (e.g. escape game, wine tasting, etc.)

## Setup

Execute the following in the Terminal:

```bash
cd ~/lewagon-workshop/02-ruby-basics/02-listing-categories/
code .
```

## Exercise

In this folder, you will find `categories.rb` - The Ruby boilerplate of the exercise.

## Objectives

The guiding theme of our challenges being activities for team building, we'll first focus on the **categories** of our team building activities (e.g. Adventure, Sport, etc.).

The goal is to display a list of all the categories of our team building activities.

Here is the expected behavior of the program:

1. Create an `Array` of categories containing at least:
Adventure, Sport, Visits, Workshops, Cultural, Food (in this **specific order**)
2. Ask the user of your program to enter an extra category
3. Display the list of the categories sorted alphabetically
4. Display the total number of categories

For instance, if the user of your program enters `Relaxing`, here is the expected output:

```
[CATEGORIES OF ACTIVITIES]
- Adventure
- Cultural
- Food
- Relaxing
- Sport
- Visits
- Workshops

Total: 7
```

Now it's your turn, complete the exercise.

## Git Commit

When you're done, don't forget to **commit and push** your changes.
